    <h1>Hello! This is a short blog about my interests projects and everything else.</h1>
    <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of Waterloo's Biomedical program and from cs courses and 
        doing some leet code questions I have transitioned over to Seneca's Computer Programming and Analysis program.
        I found it really fun and interesting to program and and loved the agency I had when learning a hard skill.
        I have a long way to go to achieve the goals which I've set for myself but I am excited for what the future holds.
